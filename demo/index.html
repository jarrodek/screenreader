      The Chrome Screen Reader is an extension developed to help visually impaired people consume web content.

      It was originally developed as a part of the Google hackathon in Warsaw, Poland, circa 2012.

      The original developers who won the hackathon are:
      
      <ul>
        <li>Pawel Uchida-Psztyc</li>
        <li>Wojciech Kalicinski</li>
      </ul>
      We didn't maintain the project for years because of the number of screen readers available on the market. However, to this day, I receive comments and questions about the extension, so I decided to rewrite the extension and actively maintain it.
